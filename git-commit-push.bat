:: Repo: https://github.com/phildeluca-gmail/pawn-hotgroups
::
:: Based on git-commit-generic.bat from the Do Not Be Lazy repo, with
:: one addition: it pulls (rebase) before pushing, so a change made on
:: another machine or on GitHub does not turn into a rejected push.
::
:: lib\ is gitignored on purpose - the game DLLs are copyrighted and are
:: never committed. Run setup-lib.bat to populate it locally.

:: NEVER commit the reference DLLs. CLAUDE.md section 1: they are

::
:: Backported from the push-*.bat scripts 2026-09-05. Not theoretical -
:: the hand-run version of this check caught Assemblies\*.dll staged
:: during the Standard Cargo split-out the same day, because
:: .gitignore's */Assemblies/*.dll needs a directory above Assemblies.
:: NOT anchored with $ on purpose. git writes LF-only line endings
:: and findstr's $ expects a CR before the LF, so the anchored form
:: silently matches NOTHING - verified against a real staged .dll on
:: 2026-09-05, which is how this was caught before it shipped. A path
:: merely containing ".dll" would be a false positive; that stops a
:: commit with a clear message, which is the safe direction to fail.
git diff --cached --name-only | findstr /i /r "\.dll \.pdb" >nul
:: The listing below uses a git pathspec rather than a pipe: a piped
:: command inside a parenthesised cmd block does not survive the ^
:: escape, and git receives the bar as an argument. And no :: comment
:: may appear INSIDE the block at all - cmd tries to run it as a
:: drive change and prints "The system cannot find the drive
:: specified". Both were caught by running this script for real on
:: 2026-09-05 rather than reading it.
